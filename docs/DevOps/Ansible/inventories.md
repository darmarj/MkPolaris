# Inventories

An inventory is a list of managed nodes, or hosts, that Ansible deploys and configures. This guide introduces you to inventories and covers the following topics:

*   Creating inventories to track a list of servers and devices that you want to automate.
*   Using dynamic inventories to track cloud services with servers and devices that are constantly starting and stopping.
*   Using patterns to automate specific sub-sets of an inventory.
*   Expanding and refining the connection methods Ansible uses for your inventory.
